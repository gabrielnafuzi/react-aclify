# react-aclify

react-aclify is a highly useful package that provides a set of tools for Access Control List (ACL) in React applications. It supports TypeScript and presents an intuitive API for managing user roles and permissions.

## Features

- **Role and Permission Management**: Utilize React hooks and components to easily manage user roles and permissions for more secure and controlled access.
- **TypeScript Friendly**: Full TypeScript support provides strong type checking for user roles, permissions, and more, enhancing the development experience.
- **Granular Access Control**: With the `CanAccess` component, control visibility of parts of your application based on user roles and permissions.
- **Context Interaction**: The `useAclify` hook provides convenient methods (`isAuthorized`) for interacting with the user's roles and permissions in your context.
- **Adaptable**: Thanks to its unopinionated design, react-aclify can be integrated with a variety of project architectures and libraries.

## Install

```bash
# npm
npm install react-aclify
# yarn
yarn add react-aclify
# pnpm
pnpm add react-aclify
```

## Usage

Use the `createAclify` function to create the components and hook for your application:

```ts
import { createAclify } from 'react-aclify'

export const { CanAccess, useAclify, AclifyProvider } = createAclify()
```

For better TypeScript support, you can also pass the Roles and Permissions types to the `createAclify` function, so that way the components and hook will be typed accordingly:

```ts
import { createAclify } from 'react-aclify'

type Role = 'admin' | 'user'
type Permission = 'posts:read' | 'posts:create' | 'posts:delete'

export const { CanAccess, useAclify, AclifyProvider } = createAclify<
  Role,
  Permission
>()
```

## `<AclifyProvider />`

The `AclifyProvider` is a context provider that you use to wrap your application, or any part of it where you want to perform role or permission-based actions. The `AclifyProvider` accepts the following props

- `userRoles`: An array of the current user's roles.

- `userPermissions`: An array of the current user's permissions.

Here's an example of how you can use the `AclifyProvider`:

```jsx
import { AclifyProvider } from '@/lib/aclify'

const App = () => {
  return (
    <AclifyProvider userRoles={['admin']} userPermissions={['read']}>
      {/* Your application goes here */}
    </AclifyProvider>
  )
}
```

## `useAclify`

The `useAclify` hook is used to interact with the `AclifyProvider` context. It returns an object with the following properties:

- `isAuthorized`: This function checks whether the user is authorized to access a certain part of the application based on their roles and permissions. It takes an object with `roles`, `permissions`, and an optional `validationMode`, and it returns a boolean indicating whether the user is authorized.

Here's an example of how to use the `useAclify` hook:

```tsx
import { useAclify } from '@/lib/aclify'

const Component = () => {
  const { isAuthorized } = useAclify()

  return (
    <div>
      {isAuthorized({ roles: ['user'], permissions: ['posts:read'] }) && (
        <div>Authorized to read posts</div>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}
```

## `<CanAccess />`

The `CanAccess` component is a convenient way of restricting certain parts of your UI based on the user's roles and permissions.

It accepts the following props:

- `roles`: An array of roles. The user must have at least one of these roles to access the children of the `CanAccess` component.

- `permissions`: An optional array of permissions. If specified, the user must also have these permissions to access the children.

- `validationMode`: Optional. Defines how roles and permissions are validated. It accepts:

  - `'all'`: All roles/permissions must match.
  - `'some'`: At least one role/permission must match.

- `children`: The content that should be rendered if the user has the required roles and permissions.

- `fallback`: An optional component or element to be rendered if the user does not have the required roles or permissions.

Here's an example of how to use the `CanAccess` component:

```tsx
import { CanAccess } from '@/lib/aclify'

const Component = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <CanAccess
        roles={['user']}
        permissions={['posts:read']}
        fallback={<div>Not authorized</div>}
      >
        <div>Authorized to read posts</div>
      </CanAccess>
    </div>
  )
}
```
